## Summary
Per our analysis, Video game reviews on Amazon received 51.1% 5 star reviews from Vine members, 12% more than non-Vine members. When comparing 5 star reviews we may say there is a bias with Vine members, however, if we factor in all reviews with 20 or more votes, we can see that unpaid reviews yield 62% helpful reviews while paid reviews yield 85% helpful reviews. While paid reviews may recieve 12% more 5 Star reviews, they are also producing 23% more helpful reviews. Since helpful reviews recieve votes from the public, not just paid Vine members, I would say paid reviews could potential reduce bias overall as counters unhelpful reviews.
